Hie Team

I am new in the use of GitHub. So I kindly your valuable advice each time I make a mistake. I am an experienced coder but I need quick tools that assist in producing code in JAVA at a fast pace but accurate one in order to deliver our project on time.
I am very happy to be using this GitHub platform to work as a team on parts of the project.
